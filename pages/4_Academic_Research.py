st.markdown('''
    In theoretical physics, there are a number of mysteriouse questions in gravity and elementary particle. Famous physicists like Einstien, Halking, Oppenheimer\
         and so on also spent their entire life to unify gravity and elementary particle (quantum physics)''')
st.markdown(''' The main problem is that the gravity and quantum physics are builded up by differences of fundamental. We now end-up with unification of theories\
        unified theory. The unification is well known as `gauge/gravity duality`. The theories have been developing for 20s years, we now have elementary-particle\
            /gravity duality, fluid-dynamics/gravity duality, Condensed Matter Physics/gravity duality. All of them are simply called `Holographic Principle`''')
st.markdown('''Holography is a principle that state that weakly interacting classical gravitational gravity in $n+1$ dimensions is equivelent to strongly coupling quantum theory.\
    in $n$ dimensions. Now it is natural to be asked by people "why we need this". The answer is very simple, it is because we cannot \
            solve strongly coupling quantum systems easily, while strongly coupling quantum systems have several extraordinary properties and features, which\
                might become a part of next generation tenmologies. For example, superconductivity, Mott insulator, Weyl semimetals, flat-band, and so-on''')
