st.markdown('''
    In theoretical physics, there are a number of mysteriouse questions in gravity and elementary particle. Famous physicists like Einstien, Halking, Oppenheimer\
         and so on also spent their entire life to unify gravity and elementary particle (quantum physics)''')
st.markdown(''' The main problem is that the gravity and quantum physics are builded up by differences of fundamental. We now end-up with unification of theories\
        unified theory. The unification is well known as `duality`''')
